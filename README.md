ðŸ©º NCIC Live A&E Monitor

This is a Python application that allows you to view live data of the amount of patients in A&E and the latest waiting times, at North Cumbria Integrated Care (NCIC) facilities. The data is scraped from the ncic.nhs.uk waiting times page and displayed in a user-friendly GUI.


## Features

    Real-time Data: Displays the latest A&E and UTC waiting times for NCIC hospitals

    Auto-refresh: The app automatically refreshes data every 5 minutes with a countdown timer.

    Customizable UI: The interface is split into two sections for A&E and UTC departments, with hospital names highlighted for clarity.

    Data Fetching: Uses BeautifulSoup to scrape HTML tables from the NHS website, parsing the relevant data on patients, wait times, and arrivals.
